# The Zen of Koi

Objects are great, let's make every thing one of those.

Though allowing those objects to be express themselves is also great.

Conversion is beautiful, let's allow each type to be converted to whatever type it wants to be, whether temporary or permanent.

Errors should be noticed, and so all will cause the program to halt, but they are not enough to crash when code is not used.

Although knowing when unused code is incorrect can be handy, warnings shall be used for these occasions.

The users wants and needs are important, we shall try to allow them to customize the language as much as they need.

Though improvements to the language are the most important. Features are not solid, and their implementation may change.

But attempts to ease changes to the newer version will be made.
